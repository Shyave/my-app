This repository is used for showing the demo of the ng4 app. A small app built by me.

I have implemented this app based on the following concepts:
1. Data binding.
2. Creating components & it's interactions between Parent component to Child component by using (@Input). I have done reverse by using (@Output).
3. Routing.
4. Child Routes.
5. Data Get & Post by using Observables.
6. Dependency Injection (Services).
7. Error Handling.

To install this app, please follow the steps.
1. Please make sure you have the necessary softwares for Angular to work.
2. Install Angular CLI globally.
3. Clone this code & do cd my-app
4. Type npm install
5. After that, type npm start in your command prompt.
